# Linux-user-clone
bash script to clone a linux user. This is by no means my invention, and I have simply taken pieces from others and will put some of my own spin on this over time 

Usage:
$ clone-user src_user_name new_user_name

Make sure to set the back script with permissions to execute:
$ chmod u+x clone-user
